                <p>I haven't done too much in my life thus far. Or at least, not much that's worth showing off. Still, I have a few projects that I'd 
                like to show off.<br>By the way, all these pictures double as links to my projects.</p>

                    <p>While not all that great, I do have a few projects from my time in Scratch that I'm quite proud of. For example, a platformer I made.
                    You can find out more about it, and my other projects on Scratch, if you look at my original portfolio.<br>
                    And yes, 7th grade me was cringy like nothing else. Who the hell names themselves _master_coder_? Ha...</p>

                    <p>Here's my original portfolio: a little thing I made over the span of 2 weeks during the summer. It was challenging, but fun. In the end,
                        though, you can notice my motivation dwindling as I finish up. There's still some placeholder text on the front page, and some progress
                        I made on the last few days wasn't documented on the calendar. And I also misspelled "Calendar" in the source code. Oops!

                    <p>Oh, well doesn't this look familiar? Both because I made it during this internship, and because I really liked how it looked so I
                        used the same general look for this website. Nothing fancy, but I really liked how it turned out.
